## Executive Summary
To support Qubic‚Äôs accelerating momentum, I propose a 2-month video media campaign to onboard new users, inform the community, and improve the project‚Äôs online visibility.

With support of **1 billion Qubic per month**, I will reduce my employment hours and dedicate focused time to content production, resulting in:
- ‚úÖ **25 educational YouTube videos** (15 in Month 1, 10 in Month 2)  
- ‚úÖ **40+ X (Twitter) posts**  
- ‚úÖ **1 flagship documentary-style video** investigating the theory that Qubic creator Sergey Ivancheglo (CFB) is Satoshi Nakamoto and what that means for Qubic

This initiative is strategically timed to amplify Qubic's presence during a potential breakout moment in the broader crypto market.

## About Me
I am the content creator behind ‚ÄúThe Great Crypto Escape,‚Äù a YouTube and X (Twitter) presence focused on blockchain technology, now fully dedicated to Qubic.

**Current Reach:**  
- üì∫ 8,000+ YouTube subscribers  
- üê¶ 4,000+ X (Twitter) followers  

I‚Äôve invested thousands of hours into understanding Qubic‚Äôs technical foundations, making my content both accessible and deeply informed. My mission is to be the go-to resource for trustworthy Qubic education and insight.

---

## The Problem
Qubic currently lacks sufficient presence on platforms like YouTube and Google, which limits discoverability for newcomers. High-quality educational content is in demand but underproduced.

Each video takes ~5 hours to produce, and while the content consistently garners views ($30/month), it is not enough to sustain consistent output alongside a full-time job and family life (I recently became a father).

Community demand is high, but capacity is limited without support. This proposal bridges that gap.

| Month  | Deliverables                                      | Estimated Hours |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Month 1| 15 YouTube videos + 20 X posts + doc prep          | ~125 hrs        |
| Month 2| 10 YouTube videos + 20 X posts + doc completion    | ~95 hrs         |

**Total Output (Over 2 Months):**  
- üé• **25 YouTube videos** (5‚Äì30 minutes each)  
- üßµ **40+ X posts**  
- üé¨ **1 documentary film (~60 mins)**  
- üïí **~220 hours of work**

## Funding Breakdown
**Requested Funding:**  
- 1B Qubic/month √ó 2 months = **2B Qubic**  
- At $3,000 per billion = **$6,000 total**  
- Monthly Equivalent: **$3,000**  

| Month  | Hours | Monthly USD Equivalent | Effective Hourly Rate |
|--------|-------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Month 1| 125   | ~$3,000                 | ~$24.00/hr            |
| Month 2| 95    | ~$3,000                 | ~$31.58/hr            |
| **Total** | 220 | $6,000                  | ~$27.27/hr avg        |

The rate remains significantly below standard freelance video production rates ($40‚Äì$100/hr), making this a highly cost-effective investment in Qubic awareness and adoption.
